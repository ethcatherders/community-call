# Ethereum Community Call

The Ethereum Community Call is open to all individuals who self-identify as members of the Ethereum community. Calls happen roughly every two weeks using the [Zoom](https://zoom.us) videoconferencing software. The link to join each meeting will be posted in the main Ethereum Cat Herders Gitter channel shortly before the call. (Yes, we are making you show a little proof of work to find the link, but we assure you it is easy to find.)

## Next call

The next call is scheduled for [Friday, April 19 at 14:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Ethereum+Community+Call&iso=20190419T14&p1=1440&ah=1). The call link will be posted shortly before the call in the main Cat Herders Gitter channel.

## Process

- Calls will not be recorded nor livestreamed. They are conducted under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/chatham-house-rule): "participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed."
- Calls are open to all community members. Attendance may be capped if necessary. (The Zoom software supports a maximum of 100 participants.)
- Calls do not have a specific agenda. Anyone may speak or ask about any topic at any time, whether technical or not.

## Code of conduct

All participants are expected to abide by the following code of conduct. Participants who violate the code of conduct will be warned by a moderator, and may be muted or ejected from a call after multiple violations.

- Be respectful of everyone's time, and ensure that everyone has an opportunity to speak. Limit questions and comments to 2-3 minutes.
- Be ridiculously friendly and constructive. Keep comments and challenges in the top three sections of the [Hierarchy of Disagreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Graham%27s_Hierarchy_of_Disagreement.svg). In particular, ad hominem, name-calling, and comments that are overly adversarial, antagonistic, or not constructive are not permitted.
- You may introduce or ask about any topic related to Ethereum, broadly defined.
